# Azure DevOps cli tool

## About
Just a simple idea to playground with [Deno](deno.land) and a faster way to do some things in Azure DevOps without the website. Azure DevOps has an [official js client](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-node-api) and this one should not be taken seriously, it's just a sample to test new things.

## Env vars
All needed variables are described in `.env.example` file and are needed in order to run this tool.

## Usage
#### `ad pr`
Lists all pull requests. Uses the env var to decide wich ones will be displayed.
